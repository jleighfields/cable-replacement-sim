# cable-replacement-sim

Simulation of underground cable failure and replacement policy for an electric
distribution utility, with a Rust compute kernel exposed to Python via
PyO3/maturin.

Censored-MLE Weibull failure model, three-phase segments governed by the
minimum of three conductor lifetimes, and budget-constrained replacement
policies evaluated against customer reliability (SAIFI / SAIDI / CMI) over a
30-year horizon. All inputs are parameterized via config; the cable population
is fully synthetic.

**Status: planning. No code yet.** See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
